# Introduction
This repository contains a Python application built using the Flask framework that connects to the Twilio API for sending and receiving text messages. The application also uses the OpenAI API to process the messages and respond accordingly.

## Prerequisites
- Python 3.x
- Flask
- Twilio Python library
- OpenAI Python library

## Installation
- Clone the repository
- Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended)
- Install the required libraries using pip: pip install -r requirements.txt
- Add your Twilio account SID, auth token, and a Twilio phone number in the config.py file.
- Add your OpenAI API key in the config.py file.
- Run the application using the command python app.py

## Usage
The application will run on http://localhost:5000 by default. You can send a message to the Twilio phone number configured in the config.py file, and the application will respond with a message generated by the OpenAI API.
